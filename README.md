- Attaining position as mentor allowed/permitted granted opportunistic platform in broadening  and sharpening my communicational and linguistical in association with refining my technical skillset respectively.

                                      **** Notebook Title: Explanatory Data Analysis for Breast Cancer Dataset.***


- The following particularly focus on developmental methodical steps for Intro. Data Science Fundamentals in accommodation with further manipulative and critical analysis steps respectively.

 
 		Structural formatted comprehensive Data Dictionary whereby illustrating the Covariate Analysis Background of the dataset coupled with the theoretical analysis of the diverse range of variables established [; 1) Patient and Metastatic Triple Breast Cancer information , 2) Patient Population and Density Representation, 3) Property Economics Value and Ownership ( income_household_median, income_household_six_figure, etc, ) , 3) Residential Labour and Education Status (education_college_or_above , labor_force_participation ) ,  Race and Ethnicity ( Hispanic,  race_white), Age Grouping Distribution(age_under_10)]


	Exploration of Breast Cancer Dataset via plethora of fundamental Data Science techniques/principles such as ( Data Ingestion, Data Pre-processing, Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA); Data Visualization ) in highlighting and conveying meaningful information.


	Overview of the Dataset(Train/Test), insightfully incorporated {: .shape, .info(), .dtypes; .unique(), .describe(), .head() , .isna(), duplicated(), etc}. Proceeded with explanatory analysis of missing values within our Dataset, highlight overall distribution NAN-value percentages accordingly.


	Conducted  EDA on the missing Values both on the Training/Testing Dataset incorporating dictionary;  key [k for k, v in dict(BreastCancer_Train_Data] function methodology showcasing different various NAN- value distributional percentage ( >=50% , <50%, <10%, <1%).


	The multi-beneficiary usage of plotly express library really distinguishes in-depth comprehensive graphical overview: {highlight data points, preparation of DataFrame before chart manifestation, overall background visualization and  template}


	Afterwards, proceeding in overview analysis of the exploration and Data visualisation underlying relationships factors in regards to patients’ Scio-economic status,  Characteristics Data Status, Environmental Condition. Some various distinctive types of graphs include: { pie-chart , barplot showcasing Relative Frequency Pat. Diagnosis Treatment, Kernel density plot of distribution of features numerical and categorical)![image](https://github.com/VideshJagai/WIDS_Mentorship_Resources_2024/assets/94847951/ae2b4061-aa95-4af1-b0f5-678435991141)
